# how
Problem solver

`how` is a general-purpose problem solver. It can give you an answer to everything.

Usage:

  Execute `how does this work` in a POSIX-compatible shell for usage information.
  Some examples:
  
    how do computers work
    how does grep work
    how does sudo work
    how to install Gentoo
  
Installation

  Execute `how to install how` to know how to install how. Or just `make install` (and `make remove` to remove).
  
  `links` is recommended, but you can change it in the HOW_BROWSER environment variable.
